# Lenovo Thinkpad x270s-Clover
Clover Bootloader, Kexts, config and ACPI patches for ThinkPad x270.
Based on nicogig's repo: https://github.com/nicogig/T460s-Clover which is based in https://github.com/tluck/Lenovo-T460-Clover repo from tluck.

## What's different from nicogig's Clover config
- Audio device id different.

## What's working
Pretty much everything that's working with tluck's config, with the addition of multitouch, Force Touch (emulated) and the LTE Modem.

## What's not working
- SD Card reader
- Physical mouse buttons

## Testing
The config uploaded here was tested on a ThinkPad x270 with an i5-6200U CPU, Intel HD Graphics 520 GPU, 8GB RAM, 256GB NVMe Drive and a FHD Screen. 

## Credit
Thanks to nicogig and tluck for laying the groundwork for a working hackintosh on the x270 with i5 6200U CPU. I'd also like to thank RehabMan, Shmilee, vusun123, TimeWalker, Mieze and every other hacker who makes Hackintoshing possible.
